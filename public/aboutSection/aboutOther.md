Beyond engineering and education, I express creativity through performance arts by blending motion, storytelling, and audience interaction. My work as a Wushu performer, mascot, and live actor has taught me presence, adaptability, and the power of connecting with people emotionally.
As a drone FPV hobbyist, I extend this creativity into the skies by using flight as a form of visual art and performance. Each experience fuels my appreciation for artistic discipline, improvisation, and the joy of crafting memorable moments.
